Red Hat STIG with GUI for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10
=========

Ansible Role for Red Hat STIG with GUI for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10  
  
Profile Description:  
This is a profile based on what is expected in the RHEL 10 STIG.  
It is not based on the DISA STIG for RHEL 10, because it was not available at time of  
the release.  
In addition to being applicable to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10, this  
configuration baseline is applicable to the operating system tier of  
Red Hat technologies that are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.  
Warning: The installation and use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)  
increases your attack vector and decreases your overall security posture. If  
your Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) lacks a documented operational  
requirement for a graphical user interface, please consider using the  
standard DISA STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 profile.

The tasks that are used in this role are generated using OpenSCAP.
